# Methods
- One-Way Methods
	- These methods may or many not accept values, but definitely does not return any value
	- USe the 'void' keyword that represents method is One-way
- Two-Way Methods
	- These methods may or many not accept values, but definitely return value
	- They uses keyword of datatype to represent what type of dat is returned
- Rules for Preventing the APplication from any crash
	- If the Crash is happing because of Wrong Type of data, then prvent it by checking the Type of INput Data
		- use the 'typeof()' operator to verify the type of data usin the 'if' condition

# C# Programming Features
- Programming COnstructs
	- if Statement, if..else statement, if...else...if Nested if
	- Loops
		- for..loop
		- foreach..loop
		- while
		- do..while
- Data Structures
	- Array
		- A CLass that represents mutiple values of SAME-TYPE
		- Any array declared in the application, will be by-default will be an instance of Array Class. 
	- System.Collections namespace
		- ArayList, LinkedList Queue, Stack, etc.
			- Each Entry is stored as Object
	- System.Collections.Generics
		- Generic Concept
- Object Oriented Programming in C#
	- class
		- Access Specifiers
			- private : Set the access of declaration (Data Member, Method, Property) within the class, 
			- public: Set the access of declaration 'Everywhere by any consumer of the class', 
			- protected: Set the access of declaration within class an its derive class, 
			- internal: Set the access of declaration withing a containing namespace and assembly,
			- protected internal: Set the access of declaration in same assemly in derived class also in derived class of dirrerent assemly
			- 
		- Modifiers
			- abstract: When used for class, it is abstract class and it cannot be instntiated, i.e. cannot be repesented as a 'REACL-WORLD' object,
				- WHen used for the method, then the method does not have any logic (Implementation)
				- The Abstract class 'MUST BE INHERITED'
				- The Abstract methos 'MUST BE OVERIIDEN'
					- Write your logic
			- virtual: APplied only on the method, this has an implementation (logic), but this can be changed by the derived class , 
			- static : a class of which instance cannot be created, this is also knws as a 'Shared' class. The static class can have only static method,
			- sealed: Class which cannot be inherited sealed methods cannot be overriden ,
			- override: COmpletely Change implementation of virtual method of te base class or use its as it is in derived class, 
			- new: Shadowing
