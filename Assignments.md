1. Create a class, that contains public method for following operations
	- RaisedTo(x,y) return x raised to y
	- Factorial(x) retun n!
	- Trignoetry(string trignotype, int val)
		- trignotype: can have values as 'sin', 'cos', 'tan'
		- value: can be 90, 60,45, 80,360
		- this method returns trignotype(value)
	- Area(string shape, double [] Dimension) return area as duble
		- shape: can be circle, rectangle, elipse, trangle, square
		- [] Dimension, will accept values in array and they will be used based on formulas used to calculate array based on shape
			- e.g. if shape is square the area = l * l
				- from array only choose first value
